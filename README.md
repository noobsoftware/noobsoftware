-  Hi, I’m @noobsoftware

We specialize in web applications, macOS apps and multiplatform apps for macOS, Windows and Android. For all types of web apps and apps we use a combination of JavaScript, PHP as well as HTML and CSS. For web development we have a framework called Streamline which supports web applications with multiple pages without ever having to reload the web page while still providing navigated URLs for each page as well as animations when transitioning between pages.
